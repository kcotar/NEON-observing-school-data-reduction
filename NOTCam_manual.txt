Steps to be taken for the reduction of NOTCam NirIR images (short exposure, many images, high background, dithering)

1 Create a flat:
- median combine and mode scale flats with some weak sigma clipping
- repeat for high and low flats
- create final normalized flat as (high - low) / median(high - low)

2 Sky substraction using python code
- determine range of images and flat images
- determine if you want a running median sky for the substraction
- run	sky_substraction.py
- creates normalized sky substracted images
- outputs list to be used in iraf

3 Create final image
- run imcombine function on final list of reduced images
- for offset use world as it stacks images using ra and dec information
- offset determined by determine_shifts.py are not usefull for  iraf imcombine/imshift functions
- run and show final image
